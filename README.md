# NETFLIX RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 

## Overview
This project focuses on the fundamental concepts related to the tools and techniques used for data preparation, visualization, and analysis in the context of Netflix's dataset. 

## Tools and Techniques Used

### 1. Data Import and Preparation
- **NumPy**: Used for linear algebra operations.
- **Pandas**: Employed for data preparation tasks.

### 2. Data Visualization
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for creating visualizations to represent data patterns.
- **Seaborn**: Used to visualize relationships and patterns within the dataset.

### 3. Data Analysis
- **Statistical Summary**: Involves analyzing object columns to understand data distribution.
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing issues like missing values and duplicates to ensure data quality.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Correlation Analysis**: Visualizing relationships between variables to identify patterns.
- **Yearly Loading Analysis**: Examining the distribution of movies and TV shows loaded each year.

### 5. Machine Learning Approach and Tableau
The project implements a machine learning approach based on Cosine similarity and utilizes Tableau for in-depth analysis of the Netflix dataset. 

#### Initial Steps
- Data preparation, including handling null values and categorizing data.
- Conducting exploratory analysis to understand content distribution and trends over the years.

#### Machine Learning Models
- ML models are introduced to predict viewer preferences and content popularity, adding a predictive dimension to the analysis.

#### Tableau Integration
- Tableau is used to create interactive dashboards, presenting both exploratory findings and ML predictions in an accessible manner. This aids in decision-making and strategy formulation for content management.
